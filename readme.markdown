This code contains several Python files:

=> The main.py file contains the class TrainRoads with all the methods to answer the exercise's questions.

=> The tests.py file tests the functionality of the methods contained in the "main.py" file.


=> The "main (fastest method).py" file is a former version of the main.py file with a different method for possible roads calculations.
It uses a cascade of 11 for loops to create all the possible roads: is it not a great looking code but the calculation time is way faster that the cleaner method contained in the main.py file.

=> The "Code with Integrated User Interface.py" file contains the same class as the "main (fastest method).py" file but also contains a GUI that can be used from an IDE or a Terminal.
Just run it the the following command line in a Terminal:

python "Code with Integrated User Interface.py"

Once the program starts, it will ask for an input (for example: AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE67, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7) and asks you what part of the program you want to use.
All the parameters required for calculations will be asked to the user.
